            <h3 className="section-subtitle">I began designing websites over 6 years ago when my local band needed an internet presence. Since then, I have been building websites using many approaches, including WordPress/Wix templates, HTML & CSS designs from scratch, as well as with technologies like React and Angular. Although I prefer front-end development, I have experience with backend development and would consider myself a full-stack developer.</h3>
